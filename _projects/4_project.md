We developed two methods for train detection and tracking in fiber optic DAS systems, categorized into waterfall-based and spectrogram-based approaches. The former uses classical computer vision techniques, while the latter employs image processing techniques. Additionally, a neural network-based learning method is proposed.

Physical factors, such as temperature and strain, have a notable impact on the acquired signal in the system. In a typical DAS system, the maximum fiber optic cable length is limited to 50 km due to channel attenuation and physical constraints. The system uses a 100 ns pulse, resulting in a 10-meter spatial separation between adjacent channels. Since light travels through fibers at a speed of approximately 2.01 Ã— 10^8 m/s, the system's sampling frequency is 2 kHz. Waterfall images are generated with signal processing using raw data obtained by sensor.

Algorithm comprises of 3 modules: Bounding box detection, boundary detection and tracking.

In the boundary detection module, the start and end points of train traces are detected using patches found in the bounding box detection module.

 spectrogram provides the spectral information necessary to tell apart two signals that may appear similar because their main frequencies are similar, like low frequency noises. We use this representation to detect and track the train traces.

The purpose of the preprocessing is to mask noises and indicate railroad tracks. Preprocessing comprises of 4 components. We need to normalize the data through all the channels in order to compensate for the inconsistencies caused by the sensor.
