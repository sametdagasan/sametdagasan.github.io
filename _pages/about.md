Hi, I'm Abdulsamet Dagasan. I received my B.Sc. and M.S. from Bilkent University, Electrical-Electronics Engineering department at Ankara, Turkey. I am currently doing my Ph.D. at Bilkent University. I am a Research and design developer at Aselsan. I work on Machine Learning and Signal Processing. I mainly use Python, C++ and MATLAB to do my daily tasks.
