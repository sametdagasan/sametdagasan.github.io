My expertise lies in utilizing signal processing and machine learning for the classification of acoustic signals, where I work with multi-channel acoustic data obtained through a DAS (distributed acoustic sensing) system. I actively participate in exploratory data analysis and concentrate on the creation and enhancement of methods for data-driven decision-making. I mainly use Python, C++ and MATLAB to do my daily tasks. 

My research primarily focuses on wireless communication systems involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In the course of my Master's thesis, I conducted an investigation into airborne ground surveillance employing cooperative Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The focus of the study was on establishing a connection between two UAVs while concurrently preserving their respective objectives. Additionally, an examination of autonomous trajectory planning for another UAV was undertaken, with the singular aim of prolonging the network's operational lifespan between cooperative UAVs.

I received my B.Sc. and M.S. from Bilkent University, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Ankara, Turkey.
