The project is a security-focused system that uses an IP camera mounted on a vehicle to recognize and process data about nearby vehicles. It provides output information, including license plates, color, brand, and model of vehicles within a 3-5 meter range. The project involves several steps, including dataset creation and training of learning algorithms. Tests are conducted under varying weather conditions, resulting in recognition accuracies of 95% for license plate recognition, 96% for brand recognition, 70% for model recognition, and 94% for color recognition.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
